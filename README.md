# PetDesk Sample Project API

The API is a .NET Core minimal Web API written in C#.

The API repo is located [here](https://github.com/chris-laur/pet-desk-api).

The API is hosted [here](https://petdeskapi2.azurewebsites.net).

To run the app locally:

-   Pull the code down from the repo
-   Open the folder containing the code in VS Code
-   Type Ctrl+F5

\*Note: you won't see anything on the root path when the app is launched in the browser but if you have started the client app you can now refresh it and see the data fetched from the API.
